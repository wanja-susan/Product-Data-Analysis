## Monthly Revenue in 2024

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a3e5b7e-312e-46a0-b4b9-6bb5979a9217)

This chart shows monthly revenue performance in 2024, with an average benchmark line.

-  Revenue hovered close to the **$38.6K monthly average**, showing consistency throughout the year.
-  **March and October** are the top performers, suggesting ideal campaign periods.
-  **January and June** underperformed ‚Äî could benefit from targeted interventions.

üìå *Seasonal awareness can guide smarter monetization strategies.*

## Saving Frequency by Location

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9532aad-ba66-42fe-9b73-7df80215c047)

This stacked chart shows how saving frequency varies across the top 5 user locations.

-  **Bi-weekly saving is the most popular known frequency**, especially in W. Michael (28 users) and Lake.Michael (24 users).
- **Monthly saving spikes in New.Michael**, where 25 users save on a monthly basis‚Äîhigher than any other frequency in that region.
- **Unknown frequency remains high** across all regions ‚Äî S.Michael and N.Michael each have 25+ users with undefined plans.
- **New.Michael shows a more balanced frequency mix**, but still has 15 users under "Unknown".

üìå *To improve user engagement and retention, more users should be nudged to select or customize their saving frequency during onboarding.*


  ## Retention by Saving Goal

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf004bcf-31d3-4184-97ea-e802da55f884)

This chart shows the number of users retained and churned after 3 months, grouped by their saving goal.

-  **Emergency savers lead in retention**, with 14.21k users retained and only 7.83k churned.
- **Education (14.07k)** and **vacation (14.04k)** goal savers also show high retention relative to churn.
- **Retirement goal** users have the **lowest total retained** count at 13.88k but also one of the lowest churns.
- Users with **"Unknown" goals** had more churn than retirement and vacation savers, despite having nearly the same retention count.
- Across the board, users with **defined goals** outperform those without ‚Äî showing that clarity drives consistency.

| Saving Goal | Retained | Churned |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| Emergency   | 14.21k   | 7.83k   |
| Education   | 14.07k   | 7.67k   |
| Retirement  | 13.88k   | 7.82k   |
| Vacation    | 14.04k   | 7.69k   |
| Unknown     | 14.18k   | 7.85k   |

Emergency and education-focused goals have the best retention-to-churn ratio.

üìå *Clear goals = stronger retention. No goal = faster churn. This chart confirms the power of saving with purpose.*

## Quarterly Savings Trends

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0093189-590d-41a9-a14f-3223edbc612d)

This chart shows total user savings grouped by quarter from 2022 to 2025.

- **Q3 is the highest-performing quarter** in all three years ‚Äî it consistently outpaces Q1, Q2, and Q4.
- The pattern suggests users tend to save more during the **mid-year period**, possibly due to school fees, income cycles, or seasonal behavior.
- **Q1 2024 dropped significantly**, suggesting a potential lag in new user onboarding or financial fatigue after year-end spending.

üìå *QuickSave should align promotions, nudges, and features around Q3 to maximize returns.*

## Monthly User Count

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c94d9b7d-a992-4d52-9f49-70ff1bb3d870)

This line chart tracks the number of users active each month across the year.

- **User activity stays stable** between **8.5k and 9.3k users**, showing healthy engagement.
- **March (9.29k)**, **July (9.28k)**, and **October (9.24k)** are the peak months,  aligned with campaign periods.
- **February dips to 8.56k**, the lowest point ‚Äî typical due to the shorter month and early-year spending fatigue.
- Small rises in June, September, and December suggest **recoveries before or after seasonal dips**.

üìå *Overall user activity is steady, with predictable seasonal spikes that can guide campaign timing.*


## Recommendations

### Improve Onboarding  
- Reduce average **days to first save** (currently 50) through nudges and in-app prompts

### Segment and Personalize  
- Encourage users to define saving goals early (many have 'Unknown')  
- Create goal-based challenges or milestone rewards

### Monetization Opportunity  
- Explore introducing a **paid tier** for features like advanced saving automation, analytics, or goal matching

### Data Cleanup Strategy  
- Enhance future retention tracking by refining goal-type classifications and save frequency tags

## üìé Appendix

### Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

The raw dataset underwent several transformation and preparation steps to support dashboard analysis:

#### Feature Engineering

- **Days to First Save**  
  Captured the number of days between when a user enabled QuickSave and their first save event to assess onboarding and adoption speed.

- **QuickSave Status**  
  Assigned a label ("Active Saver" or "Not Adopted") based on whether the user had both a QuickSave enabled date and a save event recorded.

#### General Cleaning Steps

- Converted all date fields to a consistent format
- Added derived columns like `Month`, `Year`, and `Quarter`
- Normalized missing or inconsistent entries in `save_goal_type` and `save_frequency`
- Categorized user plans into `free` and `paid` tiers
- Removed incomplete records lacking critical data like dates or save amounts

These steps ensured data quality, consistency, and reliable KPI generation in the dashboard.
All cleaning was performed using Excel formulas and Power Query.

### My Goal as a Data Analyst

This mock project was designed to simulate a real-world product analysis scenario. As the data analyst, my core goal was to translate raw user data from the QuickSave feature into actionable insights that could help product teams:

- Understand what drives user engagement and retention
- Identify friction points in onboarding and savings behavior
- Recommend strategies for revenue growth and user satisfaction
- Present findings clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders

Beyond generating dashboards, I focused on creating a narrative around the data ‚Äî helping stakeholders see not just what is happening, but why it matters and what to do next.

This project allowed me to apply end-to-end skills including data cleaning, feature engineering, KPI selection, storytelling with charts, and professional reporting.
